updates to python games from http://inventwithpython.com

I found the games distributed in /home/pi of the raspbian image, without
any real reference to where they came from. As an experienced python
programmer, I found it frustrating to see someone teaching newbies bad
coding habbits. I set up a repo on my local machine and started trying
to remove the most glaring coding horrors.

Maybe this will evolve into a new book with the same goal of teaching
newbies, but without teaching them bad habbits. More likely, it will be
just something I hack at when I am bored.
